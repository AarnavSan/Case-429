      <p class="question">Q: When did you last see Sir Eric alive?</p>
      <p class="answer">A: Yesterday afternoon, around 7:00 PM. I went to his house to discuss... family matters.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-pair">
      <p class="question">Q: Can you describe the nature of this discussion?</p>
      <p class="answer">A: It was about his will. He had decided to remove me as a beneficiary. I was upset, obviously.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-pair">
      <p class="question">Q: How upset were you?</p>
      <p class="answer">A: I was angry. I felt betrayed. But I didn't kill him, if that's what you're implying.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-pair">
      <p class="question">Q: Where were you between 8:00 and 9:00 PM yesterday?</p>
      <p class="answer highlight-yellow">A: I left his house around 7:45 PM and drove home. I was at my apartment by 8:15 PM.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="qa-pair">
      <p class="question">Q: We have a voicemail you left for Marcus Williams. You said, "I hate him. I swear, if I had it in me, I'd kill him." Can you explain this?</p>
      <p class="answer highlight-red">A: That was just... I was venting. I was emotional. People say things they don't mean when they're upset.</p>
    </div>
