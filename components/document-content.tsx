          <strong>Flora Jasmine</strong>, a 26-year-old Black doctoral researcher, is the step-daughter of Sir Eric
          Harpe.

          She expressed aggressive intent in a voicemail to her friend the same day of the murder: "I hate him. I swear,
          if I had it in me, I'd kill him." Her interview tone was elevated and defensive. She refused to provide
          corroborating evidence for her whereabouts between 8–9 PM, and multiple inconsistencies were noted. Flora has
          a history of conflict with the victim and has been investigating his business decisions.

          Flora was also removed from the will the day the victim was murdered, suggesting an immediate possible motive.
          According to the constructed timeline, Flora was removed from the will following a heated argument with the
          victim, and the victim was murdered several hours later, making Flora's activities highly suspicious.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additional Sentiment Analysis suggests that Flora's audio tone was hostile and the language used was
          threatening. As a Black stepchild of a white father, the subject may have had a troubled childhood, which was
          displayed in signs of noncompliance and challenging investigative authority.
